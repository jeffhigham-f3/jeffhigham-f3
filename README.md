## About
I‚Äôm a Senior Software Engineer and mobile expert with leadership experience who specializes in taking products from idea to MVP and then from MVP to scale. Over the past decade, I‚Äôve delivered cross-platform apps and cloud backends across healthcare, fitness, SaaS, and consumer products, with expertise spanning Flutter, React Native, Node, AWS, and Google Cloud. I am available for full-time placement, contract, or freelance roles.

With over a decade of experience delivering mobile applications and cloud-native platforms, I specialize in taking products from idea to MVP and then scaling them to enterprise-ready systems. My work consistently strikes a balance between speed, reliability, and maintainability, enabling teams to ship high-quality products quickly and sustainably.

I lead engineering teams and guided architecture across both startups and hyper-growth organizations. In those roles, I designed frameworks and tooling that solved immediate product needs while creating leverage for future development. My background includes building cross-platform mobile apps used by hundreds of thousands of users, architecting secure cloud backends on AWS and Google Cloud, and implementing compliant data systems in regulated industries like healthcare.

I practice continual improvement and adaptation as a core part of my career growth, actively incorporating modern AI-assisted workflows tactically to help accelerate delivery and reduce repetitive tasks. Using AI increases productivity and allows me to focus more on architecture, problem-solving, and building features that matter ‚Äî without compromising code quality.

Just as importantly, I promote growth-centered team cultures where collaboration and mentorship thrive. I believe the best outcomes happen when strong engineering practices align with healthy team dynamics.
